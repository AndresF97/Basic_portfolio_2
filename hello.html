                              <p>Hi my name is Andres. I was born in Colombia, but I live in America. It was a dream of mine to own some dogs when I arrived in America; as my family advance economically we were finally able to to get a dog. 
                                  The first dog we got was a half dalmation and half pitbull. It might sound like a handful which he was at the beginning since we got him when he was a pup, but with time he has calmed down. Something that 
                                  has never changed is that he has a lot of attitude problems. For example everytime I tell him to do a trick, he usually does it but when I ask him to do it in front of company he never listens, and if his mad at you he will usually
                                  ignore everything you're saying. He's a pretty weird dog but he's pretty cool.
